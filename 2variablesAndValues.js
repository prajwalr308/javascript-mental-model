Primitive values are immutable. They’re a permanent part of our JavaScript universe—we can’t create, destroy, or change them. For example, we can’t set a property on a string value because it is a primitive value. Arrays are not primitive, so we can set their properties.

Variables are not values. Each variable points to a particular value. We can change which value it points to by using the = assignment operator.

Variables are like wires. A “wire” is not a JavaScript concept—but it helps us imagine how variables point to values. When we do an assignment, there’s always a wire on the left, and an expression (resulting in a value) on the right.

Look out for contradictions. If two things that you learned seem to contradict each other, don’t get discouraged. Usually it’s a sign that there’s a deeper truth lurking underneath.

Language matters. We’re building a mental model so that we can be confident in what can or cannot happen in our universe. We might speak about these ideas in a casual way (and nitpicking is often counterproductive) but our understanding of the meaning behind the terms needs to be precise.
