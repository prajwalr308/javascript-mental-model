//Primitive values
/*
They are a permanent part of our JavaScript universe.
I can point to them, but I can’t create, destroy, or change them.
*/
//To see primitive values in practice, open your browser’s console and log them:

console.log(2);
console.log("hello");
console.log(undefined);

//Objects and Functions
/*

Objects and functions are also values but, unlike primitive values, I can manipulate them from my code. 
If primitive values are like distant stars, then objects and functions are more like asteroids floating around my planet.
They’re not part of my code, but they’re close enough to manipulate

console.log({});
console.log([]);

//checking types

console.log(typeof({})); // "object"
console.log(typeof([])); // "object"

//Expressions

console.log(2 + 2); 
//2+2
console.log(typeof(2 + 2))
//you can perform type of for expressions also
